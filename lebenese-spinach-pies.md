# Lebanese Spinach Pies
#### Recipe by Mo Moussa (Equinix)

Mo lives in Seattle, but not a day goes by that he doesn’t daydream about eating at his cousin’s restaurant, Saad’s Halal, back in West Philly, or of
having a meal at the food truck his parents ran for thirty years in University City. Born in Beirut, Mo’s parents brought their traditional food to Philadelphia with them in 1980, and Mo grew up peeling mountains of garlic with his grandmother, waking up to a sumptuous thirty-dish spread for breakfast, and eating leftovers from the food truck for dinner.

Although Mo doesn’t cook much traditional Lebanese food himself, he tries to share the joy of cooking and of spending time in the kitchen with his six-year-old son. “We make hummus together,” Mo says, “and, you know, put smiley faces on the pizza. Stuff like that.” He hasn’t been able to return to Philly for the past two years, but as soon as he’s able, these spinach pies are the first thing he looks forward to eating. After that? His cousin’s famous Chicken Maroosh: chicken, sautéed onions, garlic sauce, tomatoes, parsley and pickles on a toasted hoagie.

## INGREDIENTS

### DOUGH
* 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 3/4 cup lukewarm water
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/3 cup canola or olive oil

### FILLING
* 1 pound spinach
* 2 medium onions, finely chopped
* 2 tablespoons sumac
* 1/2 tablespoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper (optional)
* pinch cayenne pepper (optional)
* 2 tablespoons pine nuts (optional)

### DRESSING
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1-2 tablespoons
* pomegranate molasses (optional)

### YIELDS
24 small pies or 12 medium ones

## DIRECTIONS
1. In a small bowl, sprinkle yeast over the water. Let sit for a minute before stirring to combine. Let sit until frothy, about 10 minutes. In the bowl of a large food processor fitted with a dough blade, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Gradually stir in the oil, then the yeast and water combo, until until dough comes together. On a lightly greased surface, knead until smooth and elastic. Place in a large bowl, cover, and let rest 1-2 hours.
2. Heat a large pan over medium heat and drizzle with about 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add spinach and cook until just wilted. Remove to colander and squeeze out all excess moisture.
3. In a medium bowl combine onions with sumac, salt, paprika, black pepper and cayenne. Let sit for 5-10 minutes. Squeeze all excess moisture from the onions, add pine nuts and spinach.
4. In a small bowl combine lemon juice, olive oil, and pomegranate molasses. Pour over the filling ingredients until just moistened, not wet.
5. Preheat oven to 350ºF. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (or lightly grease). Divide the dough in half, covering one half as you work. On a large, oiled work surface, roll half the dough until thin, 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch. Use a 4 inch wide circle cutter to cut out circles. Place 1 tablespoon filling in the center of each. Pinch together three edges of the circle over the center of the filling. Seal down one side, then across the other to form a pyramid shape. Place on the prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining circles and other half of dough.
6. Bake in preheated oven until golden, 15-20 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.
