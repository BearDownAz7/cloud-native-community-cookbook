# **Summer-style Kebab**

#### Recipe by Dennis Irsigler

Everytime in the summer I tend to skip warm and "hearty" meals and instead choose to eat more vegetables or light meals.
This is were the "summer-style kebab" comes into the game. A easy to cook meal which reminds you of the Kebab from your favourite take-away which provides you fresh ingredients, vegetables and crunchy garlic bread to enjoy the hot days.

This is the meal I cook for my wife probably once every 2 weeks during the hot summers in Germany. It's versatile, healthy and easy to cook. Perfect for the end of a stressfull day to start relaxing and enjoying the evening outside with a cool beverage or vine of your choice.

## INGREDIENTS

The ingredients serve approxmiately 2 persons.

### Salad

- 1 cucumber
- 4 (small) tomatoes
- ~ 150 grams of yoghurt
- oliveoil
- salt
- pepper
- fresh parsley
- chili flakes

### Bread

- 1 ciabatta bread
- oliveoil
- salt
- pepper
- 1 or 2 cloves of garlic

### Meat

- 300 grams chicken breast
- sweet paprika powder

### Additional Notes

You can add whatever vegetables you like to the salad part. Additionally you can prepare and season the chicken breast as you like. For example you can experiment with preparing a buttermilk seasoning and resting the meat a day before in a container with the buttermilk in the fridge.

## DIRECTIONS

8. In a bowl combine the yoghurt with 1 tablespoon of oliveoil, some salt and pepper
9. Wash and cut the parsley
10. Cut the ciabatta bread into thumb sized bits or just tear it apart while listening to the Doom soundtrack
11. Heat up the 2 tablespoons of oliveoil in a pan and toast the ciabatta pieces in this pan
12. Cut the cloves of garlic or press them into the pan with the ciabatta to coat the bread pieces
13. Heat up another pan (or clean the previously used pan) and again add 2 tablespoons of oliveoil
14. Now add the meat and cook it accordingly. Afterwards season to taste with salt and pepper
15. Serve the plates starting with tomatoes, cucumber, parsley and the garlic bread
