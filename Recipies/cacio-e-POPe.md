# Cacio e POPe (Cacio e Pepe aka Italian Mac and Cheese)
#### POP (Sysdig/POPCAST)
I grew up in the Italian restaurant business.  One day there was a chef named Aldo who was a vagabond who taught me this dish and  the power of simple ingredients and easy preparation.
This is the ultimate comfort food for that day when you have been working on a bug for days but anyone has pasta, cheese, and olive oil in the pantry and make a truly epic dish.

## Ingredients for 2 SERVINGS

* Kosher salt
* 6 oz. pasta (such as egg tagliolini, bucatini, or spaghetti)
* 1 "punch" of the finest olive oil you can find... (SPRING FOR THE GOOD STUFF)
* 1 tsp. freshly cracked black pepper
* 1 cup finely grated Grana Padano or Parmesan (PAY FOR THE GOOD STUFF.... if i see kraft anywhere near this dish you will be banned from Cloud Native)
* 1 cup finely grated Pecorino Romano  (PAY FOR THE GOOD STUFF.... if i see kraft anywhere near this dish you will be banned from Cloud Native)

## Directions

Step 1
Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a 5-qt. pot. Season with salt; add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until about 2 minutes before tender. Drain, reserving ¾ cup pasta cooking water.

Step 2
In a Dutch oven or other large pot or skillet over medium heat heat up Olive Oil. Add pepper and cook, swirling pan, until toasted, about 1 minute.

Step 3
Add ½ cup reserved pasta water to skillet and bring to a simmer. Add pasta and remaining butter. Reduce heat to low and add Grana Padano, 
stirring and tossing with tongs until melted. Remove pan from heat; add Pecorino, stirring and tossing until cheese melts, sauce coats the pasta, and pasta is al dente. 
(Add more pasta water if sauce seems dry.) Transfer pasta to warm bowls and serve.
