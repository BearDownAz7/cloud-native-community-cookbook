# **waffle-cheese-bread**

#### Recipe by Carlos Panato

In Brazil the cheese bread—the famous "pão de queijo"—is very well known and it is delicious to eat as a snack.
With a cup of plain coffee, it's amazing.

This version uses the traditional base ingredients, but instead of it like bread, you cook it with a waffle maker instead.
This way it stays in waffle format.

## INGREDIENTS

- 1 egg
- 1 cup of milk (lactose-free also works)
- 1/2 cup of oil
- Pinch of salt (can add black pepper if want to be more hardcore)
- 50g-100g of cheese (can use mozzarella, parmesan, you can mix)
- If you love cheese you can add a bit more, but it can turn out a bit greasy in the end
- 1 cup sour starch
- 1/2 cup sweet tapioca flour

## DIRECTIONS

1. Turn on your waffle maker; it needs to be very hot
2. Mix all ingredients in a blender
3. Add some of the mix in the Waffle machine
4. Cook till it is golden
5. Can eat plain or add some Dolce de leche or any kind of jam or honey. Also can eat with bacon or anything else.
