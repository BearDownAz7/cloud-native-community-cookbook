# Dino’s Sauerbraten
#### Recipe by Andy Randall (Kinvolk)

This recipe lives in Andy’s kitchen in Berlin on a well-loved piece of paper. It’s covered in drips and stains and is scrawled in the handwriting of Andy’s wife Kathrin, as dictated by their long-time family friend Dino. Dino trained as a chef when he was young and worked in restaurants before switching to a career as a programmer at age forty. But he still loved to cook for his family and friends, and Andy was lucky to first eat this sauerbraten nearly 25 years ago at Dino’s house in Hamburg.

Sauerbraten means “sour roast” in German, and Andy tells us it’s the bite of the vinegar that makes this dish so different from the common sweet versions, and so exquisite. He also says it’s a pretty simple and foolproof recipe as long as you let the ingredients and the marinade do their work. Andy and Kathrin love to cook this dish together, especially in the darker months of winter. “When the days are short,” Andy says, “it’s nice to have a long shared meal.” Though their children are teenagers now, and in and out of the house frequently, their family has a fixed rule that everyone is home for Sunday dinner. Time together? And a chance to remember friends? And enjoy flavors like these? Yes please.

## Ingredients

1 kilogram beef (2.2
pounds), off the bone – can
also be a cheaper cut e.g.
round steak

### For the Marinade
* 3 onions
* 2 apples
* 2 carrots
* 5 bay leaves
* 10 cloves
* 10 juniper berries
* a handful of lovage
* 10 peppercorns
* 2 teaspoons salt
* sugar (plenty – about 1/4
* cup)
* 80% white vinegar + 20%
* water (the amount you need
* will depend on the shape/
* size of the dish and the
* roast – but it could easily be
* a liter or two)
* 1/2 liter red wine
* cream (to taste)
* bacon (a speck)
* cognac (optional)

### Directions
_PREPARE AT LEAST 2 DAYS BEFORE YOU PLAN TO EAT_

1. Peel and roughly cut the onions, apples and carrots. Add all the herbs/spices/salt/sugar. Cover with the vinegar/water mix until the meat and vegetables are fully covered. Leave the meat in the marinade for at least 48 hours.
2. Remove the meat from the marinade. Dry it. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Put a bit of bacon (a speck, or some pancetta) in a pan. Sear the meat all over. Douse with 1/2 liter red wine and reduce the heat.
4. After the wine has reduced a bit, add the marinade (including the vegetables). Cover the pan with a lid and cook on a low-to-medium heat for 1-2 hours, depending on the thickness of the meat.
5. After the meat has cooked, strain the sauce, and boil it down; add cream to taste; optionally add more red wine or cognac to taste.
6. Serve the meat covered in the sauce, along
