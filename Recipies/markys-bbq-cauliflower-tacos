#### Recipe by Marky Jackson

I am a lover of all things tacos. I also want to stress that tacos are not only just for Tuesday.
No no no fam! Let's teach the kids better.
Tacos can be had on any day!
Tacos do not have to have meat and can be prepared vegetarian, vegan and gluten free.

This recipe is inspired by my dear friend Raj (/me waves Hi Raj)
