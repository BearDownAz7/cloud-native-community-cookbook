#### Recipe by Marky Jackson

I am a lover of all things jalapeno. Jalapeno poppers are a must for any social gathering or just to eat alone.

## INGREDIENTS

- 1 dozen jalapeno peppers, halved 
- 1 8oz package cream cheese 
- 2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded 
- 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro 
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin 
- 1/4 cup bread crumbs 
- 2 tablespoons parmesan cheese

## DIRECTIONS

1. For the poppers, you will want to preheat the oven to 350°. Using rubber gloves, clean and seed jalapenos. Seriously, use gloves and open a window because these little buggers can be really hot.
2. Place cleaned out pepper halves on cookie sheet. You can remove gloves, but wash hands before and after handling peppers.
3. In a bowl, mix together cream cheese, shredded cheese, cilantro, and cumin. Stuff each pepper with cream cheese mixture.
4. Mix bread crumbs and parmesan cheese together. Top each pepper with a small scoop of this mixture.
5. Bake for 20 – 22 minutes or until cheese is bubbling and crumbs are light brown.
6. Post a pic somewhere!
