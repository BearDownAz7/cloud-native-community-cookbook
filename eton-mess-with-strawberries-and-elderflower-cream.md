# **Eton Mess with Strawberries & Elderflower Cream**
#### Recipe by Cheryl Hung (CNCF)

Cheryl lives in London and loves to spend her free time creating things in the kitchen. She says, “I’ll quite happily spend a day going to the farmer’s market, buying an ingredient I’ve never bought before, and then cooking something new.” This recipe was inspired both by the ingredients available at her local market and by a question The Great British Bake Off recently posed: what dessert captures your twenty-first birthday?

At twenty-one Cheryl had just graduated from University and was living in the bucolic city of Cambridge, teaching Computer Science to high school students. “That Cambridge summer,” she says, “will always make me think of garden parties and punting down the river with friends.” It also makes her think of the scent of elderflower wafting down every hillside, and of the elderflower cordial filling people’s glasses, and of the strawberries readily available, and so this Eton Mess (a classic English dessert) was born.

Cheryl says the elderflower in this dish is very floral and acidic, which provides a wonderful contrast to the sweet meringue. And the variety of textures, she tells us, compliment each other perfectly. “Just like an idyllic summer!”


## INGREDIENTS
* 2 large free-range egg whites 
* 130 grams (about 4 1/2 ounces) caster sugar
* 500 grams strawberries (you can also use a mixture of strawberries, raspberries, blackberries etc.)
* 1 teaspoon lemon juice
* 450ml (16 ounces) double cream 
* 1 tablespoon elderflower cordial

## DIRECTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 120°C (250°F) and line a large baking sheet with non-stick baking paper.
2. Whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl until they hold stiff peaks. Add the caster sugar spoonful by spoonful, whisking after each addition until you have a glossy stiff meringue.
3. Spoon dollops of the meringue onto the prepared baking sheet and bake on the bottom shelf of the oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Turn off the heat and leave to cool in the oven until the meringues are completely dry.
4. Reserve 50g of the most attractive strawberries and halve to use for decoration. Take 200g of the remaining strawberries and crush with the lemon juice into a thick strawberry compote.
5. In a large bowl, whisk the cream with the elderflower cordial until it forms soft peaks.
6. Roughly crush three-quarters of the meringues, and fold gently into the remaining chopped strawberries and cream. It’s very important to keep the components distinct and not overmix.
7. Spoon the Eton Mess mixture into small glasses, scatter over the remaining crushed meringues, and then decorate with the reserved strawberries and strawberry compote.
8. Serve immediately in order to keep the crisp meringue texture. Ideally in a garden while playing croquet on an idyllic English summer day!
