# Hazelnut cake
#### Recipe by Nicolai von Neudeck (self-employed) & Annette von Neudeck, née Matton
Annette gifted Nicolai this hazelnut cake recipe in a newly hand written cookbook when he moved from the Netherlands to Berlin. While the new cookbook was lost in a flatshare in 2006, the recipe has been in the family for at least a hundred years and is from a time when gout was a more common disease. Hence the cake is much richer than most cakes today. It is easy to bake, the ingredients do the heavy lifting.
## Ingredients
### For the cake
- 300g ground hazelnut
- 8 eggs
- 250g sugar
- 2 full tea spoons of starch
- 2 full tea spoons of backing powder
### For the topping
- cream
- sugar powder
### For making the cake not stick to the tin:
- butter (also adds a nice caramel hint)
- 75g grated rusk (unnecessary with teflon coated tins)
## Recipe
0. Preheat your oven to 160˚C.
1. Separate the egg whites from the yolks.
2. Mix the yolk with the sugar until it is foamy.
3. Incorporate the hazelnut, the starch and the backing powder into the yolk sugar mix.
4. Thoroughly clean your mixer and beat the egg white in a clean bowl (easier with a spoon of sugar or two) until it is really firm.
5. Carefully fold the stiff egg white in to the dough. The mix should be homogenous but you don't want to destroy the fluffyness of the egg white.
6. Grease an oblong baking tin with butter. If it isnt teflon coated put the grated rusk on the buttered tin walls.
7. Put the dough in the tin and bake it at 160˚C for around one hour on the middle shelf.
8. Stick the wooden pick into the cake and pull it out. If no dough is on the stick, the cake is done.
9. Take the tin out of the oven and let it cool down.
10. Turn everything over and carefully remove the tin.
11. Add powdered sugar and serve the cake on a nice plate with whipped cream.
