# Eggs in Purgatory
#### Laura Santamaria

This is one of those recipes that came from so many places and people that I don't know where I got mine from. It's likely a mixture of so many different ones.

Eggs in purgatory is of the classic "eggs poached in a tomato base" recipe family. Possibly the most famous of that recipe family is shakshuka/shakshouka from the Middle East/North Africa. Eggs in purgatory, though, is an Italian variation. You can eat it as breakfast, lunch, supper, dinner, or anything in between.

I like mine with lots of garlic and a healthy amount of red pepper flakes, but you can modify this to suit your tastes. We eat it with garlic bread made from crusty bread---the kind that holds up to lots of tomato sauce. I also rarely actually measure the spices out; I taste the tomato base before putting the eggs in and add more as I like.

## Ingredients

* at least 2 cloves of garlic, sliced thinly
* olive oil
* red pepper flakes, to taste
* 28 oz can of tomatoes, either diced or pureed (reference note 1)
* 1/2 tsp sea salt, to taste
* 1/4 tsp black pepper, to taste
* rosemary, pinch of dried or 1 sprig fresh (minimum, to taste)
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter
* 4 tbsp grated parmesan cheese (or to taste)
* 6 eggs
* garlic bread (optional, but highly recommended, the crustier the better)
* dried parsley for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. In a medium to large skillet, roast the garlic and red pepper flakes in olive oil on medium heat until they're giving off that lovely scent of garlic.
1. Add the tomatoes, salt, pepper, and rosemary (ref notes 1 and 2). If you're using pureed, stir and simmer for about 15-20 minutes. If you're using diced or whole tomatoes, simmer and smash the tomatoes until everything has broken down. Wait until wells made with a big spoon in the sauce hold a rough shape for a little bit.
1. Add the butter, parmesan cheese, more salt, and the red pepper flakes once everything's boiled down into a nice thick sauce. Taste it to ensure you've got the spices right for your preference. Give it a bit to warm up (until the butter's well distributed and melted in).
1. While all that's going on, crack eggs into a container (ref note 3).
1. Once the tomato sauce is simmering and bubbling, make wells in the sauce, evenly spaced. Slip the eggs one by one into wells you made in the tomato mixture.
1. Cook with a lid on until the whites set (see note 4). This takes around 3-4 minutes for me. Leave the yolks more on the runny side than the cooked side!
1. Then, once set, pull it off the heat, and more cheese and parsley for garnish.
1. Get some garlic bread (nice and crusty; homemade is great, but frozen works well, too) and get eating.

## Notes

1. If you don't want to spend forever mashing canned tomatoes, use pureed. If you're willing to mash them, I use the back of a wooden spoon.
1. I will add other spices as I feel like based on the day (basil, oregano, etc.). Experiment!
1. I use a container because I inevitably have to fish a shell piece out. If you're more skilled, go be bold and crack them directly into the tomato mixture.
1. The lid is *really* important. Without the lid, the whites won't cook and you end up cooking the yolks through.
