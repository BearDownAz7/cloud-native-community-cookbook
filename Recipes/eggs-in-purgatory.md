# Eggs in Purgatory
#### Laura Santamaria

This is one of those recipes that came from so many places and people that I don't know where I got mine from. It's likely a mixture of so many different ones.

Eggs in purgatory is of the classic "eggs poached in a tomato base" recipe family. Possibly the most famous of that recipe family is shakshuka/shakshouka from the Middle East/North Africa. Eggs in purgatory, though, is an Italian variation. You can eat it as breakfast, lunch, supper, dinner, or anything in between.

I like mine with lots of garlic and a healthy amount of red pepper flakes, but you can modify this to suit your tastes. We eat it with garlic bread made from crusty bread---the kind that holds up to lots of tomato sauce. I also rarely actually measure the spices out; I taste the tomato base before putting the eggs in and add more as I like.

## Ingredients

* x cloves of garlic, sliced thinly
* red pepper flakes
* 6 eggs
* 28oz can of tomatoes (I prefer pureed, but you can use plain canned tomatoes, too)
* butter
* parmesan cheese
* spices
* olive oil
* garlic bread (optional, but highly recommended)

## Directions

1. In a medium to large skillet, roast the garlic and red pepper flakes in olive oil until they're giving off that lovely scent of garlic
1. Add a gigantic can of pureed tomatoes if you don't want to spend forever mashing canned tomatoes along with all of the spices you want
1. Then heat. Wait until wells made with a big spoon in the sauce for the eggs hold a rough shape for a little bit.
1. Add butter and a bunch of the parmesan cheese once everything's boiled down into a nice thick sauce. Give it a bit to warm up (until the butter's well distributed and melted in).
1. While all that's going on, crack eggs into a container (because I still get eggshells in my eggs and I don't feel like fishing them out of a hot skillet), then slip them one by one into wells you make in the tomato mixture.
1. Cook with a lid on until the whites set---the lid's important as it won't heat right otherwise!
1. Then, once set, pull it off the heat, add cheese and any other seasonings on top. I always add salt and pepper, then decide what I feel like with the spices I added.
1. Get some garlic bread (nice and crusty; homemade is great, but frozen works well, too) and get eating.
