# Cream Cheese Pound Cake

#### Tracy P Holmes

I absolutely LOVE baking, and this cake is one of those things I'm always asked to bring to gatherings or that people request around the holidays. Not only is baking my happy place (similar to gardening), once I learned HOW to bake, I was a solid addition to the holidays. Which meant I was right there with my grandma and mom. Anyway, here's a quick backstory.

I grew up in the "country" (yep, full on rural!) When I was younger and would get upset, I'd go outside and chop wood or chop on whatever wood was laying around. My mom had started learning how to decorate cakes, and would take me with her. So, one day, I asked if I could bake a cake instead. We had these AMAZING [Bell's Best](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22308106-bell-s-best-cookbook) cookbooks, and this recipe was the very first one I tried (the 2nd was a Sour Cream Pound Cake). And it's been my go to ever since then!

## Ingredients

- 2 sticks unsalted butter, softened (226g)
- 1 stick margarine/oleo, softened (113g)
- 1 (8 oz) pkg. cream cheese, softened (227g)
- 3 cups sugar (594g)
- 7 large eggs (I find room temp works best)
- 3 cups all-purpose flour, sifted (360g)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract (4.2g)
- 1 tsp almond extract (4.2g)

### SPECIAL EQUIPMENT

- 9" or 10" Bundt pan or 1-piece tube pan
- Stand mixer (or a hand mixer will also work!)
- Toothpick for testing
- A wet towel for wiping your face after licking the bowl

## Directions

1. Cream butter, cream cheese, and sugar
2. Add eggs alternately with flour
3. Add in vanilla and almond extracts
4. Place batter in large greased and floured pan in middle of COLD oven. Note: Cake MUST be started in a cold oven!! Note: You can use vegetable spray or baking spray for this also. Greasing & flouring can be inconsistent.
5. Bake at 325°F (162°C) for approximately 1.5 hours. DO NOT open oven door at any time until cake is done or until roughly 5 mins before expected in order to check for doneness (toothpick works great for this - if you see anything on the toothpick, it needs to cook for a wee bit longer).
6. After removing cake from oven, let cake sit for 5-7 mins before inverting pan for removal

### STORAGE

This cake is countertop stable. Just make sure you have it in a cake keeper, or wrapped in cling wrap or the like. You can absolutely also store it in the freezer. To do so, wait until cake has cooled. Then make sure to wrap it completely in cling wrap followed by completely wrapping it with aluminum foil. The cake should keep for 4 - 5 months! When ready to ~~demolish~~ eat it, thaw it a day before needed.
