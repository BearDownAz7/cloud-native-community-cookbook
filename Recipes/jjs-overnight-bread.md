## Recipe by JJ Asghar (inspired by multilpe other recipes)

Every once in a while, you need to make a loaf of bread. This recipe is my default "overnight" recipe that I've stolen and been influnenced by the internet. It takes a couple times to get right, but when when you do, the bread culture opens up to you. Have fun!

### Equipment

- Stand Mixer with paddle and bread hook
- At least one proofing basket
- Bench scraper
- Partchment paper
- Dutch Oven or Clay Pot
- Sharp knife

### INGREDIENTS

- 1000g (1 kg) of flour (bread flour if you want)
- 20g of salt (kosher salt is what i use)
- 2 1/3 cups of "warm/hot" water
- 1/4 tea spoon of dried yeast

### DIRECTIONS

1. Heat up your water, I use the "hot" setting on my sink, to the point "ouchie."
2. Put the flour into your standmixer, then add the water.
3. Turn on the standmixer with your paddle attachement, till it's incorporated. It should look "even" and no dry bits flour left
4. Wait for about 30 mins, leaving the paddle and standmixer alone.
5. At about 30 mins, take out the paddle mixer, and put the dried yeast and salt into the mixer, try to get it around evenly, but just don't "dump it in."
6. Turn on the standmixer with the bread hook, start the at "1" then go to "2", let it run for anywhere between 10 mins to 50 mins. What you are looking for is the dough to come together with "none of it" sticking to the bowl. You might have to be patient here, but it doesn't hurt to wait.
7. After the dough has come together, turn off the standmixer, take the bowl out of the mixer and cover it with plastic wrap or the like.
8. Come back "over night" and ideally your bread has risen. If not, it's ok, find a warm place, like your oven on the lowest setting and put it in for an hour or so.
9. After risen bread, turn on your oven to the lowest setting possible, ideally 100 degrees F, and take your dough out of your mixing bowl.
10. Put some flower in your proofing basket.
11. Split your dough into two loafs using the bench scraper and "shape" them buy tucking the outsides into the underside of the center. Shaping is it's own skill, there are TONs of YouTube videos on it.
12. Take one of the shaped loafs put it "seam side up" into the basket.
13. Place the basket with partchment paper with a plate on top to make a "seal" in the oven.
14. Wait about an hour.
15. Take out the basket, put in a dutch oven, or clay pot, with the lid on,  into the oven and crank the oven to ~500 degrees F, or however hot it can get.
16. Wait till the oven has hit the previous tempature, and then wait another ~30 mins.
17. Take the dough out of the basket by flipping the basket over carfully onto the partchment paper, and "score" the top of the dough. If you have never done that, the best thing is a sharp knife from one side to the other in one motion.
18. Take the Dutch oven or clay pot out of the oven, and put it with the lid on some place you can reach it.
19. Open the duch oven or clay pot, and take the paper from the dough and place it into the container. Be careful not to shake or move the dough to much, and don't touch the container. The paper is your friend here.
20. Cover the container with it's lid, and put it back into the 500 degree F oven. Wait about 20 mins.
21. At 20 mins, turn down the oven to 450 degrees F, and open it up, take off the lid of the container. Wait about 15 mins.
22. At 15 mins, check the color of your bread, if it's the color you like, go ahead to the next step, otherwise close it and check it every 5 mins to the color you want.
23. Take the bread out of the oven, and put it on a cooling rack, wait about 20 mins before touching it again. It is still cooking, and you need to let it rest.
24. Cut it that glorious bread, you've earned it. And if you want do the other shaped loaf, just make sure that you turn the oven back up to 500 and put the container back in, but wait the 30 mins after it's said it's heated.
