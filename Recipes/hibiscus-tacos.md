# Hibiscus Tacos
#### Recipe by Ramiro Berrelleza (Okteto)

A few years ago, while visiting his grandmother in his hometown of Guadalajara, Mexico, he found a well-thumbed volume called "Tacos de Mexico". Whether it was stolen or given to him, that's for another story. But the cookbook is now happily sitting on Ramiro's kitchen in West Oakland. One of the recipes caught his attention: it used hibiscus flowers, traditionally used to make "agua fresca",  as a topping.  Take that, plus his love for all things with tomatillo on it, and the Hibiscus Oktacos were born ðŸ˜Ž.

This recipe combines three of Ramiro's favorite things: Tangy green salsa (extra tangy thanks to the raw tomatillos), hibiscus, and tacos. Cheesy, easy to make for a big crowd, and you can eat them with your hands while standing on the stove. What else do you need in life?

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup of dry hibiscus flowers (you can get them on any Mexican or Arab market)
* 1/2 pound of queso fresco (or mozzarella cheese; anything that melts is good)
* 1 cream cheese
* Fresh tortillas (buy the good stuff at the same place where you get the hibiscus flowers)
* 2 tablespoons of canola or peanut oil

### For the green salsa
* 1 pound of tomatillos, roughly chopped
* 1 jalapeÃ±o pepper, roughly chopped
* 1 bunch of cilantro
* 1 clove of garlic
* 1/2 white onion
* 2 tablespoons of white vinegar
* Salt
* Pepper

## Directions

1. Put the dry hibiscus flowers on a bowl of water and let them hydrate for 30 minutes.
2. While the hibiscus hydrates, prepare the salsa. Throw everything on a food processor, and pulse for a couple of minutes until thoroughly chopped. If the sauce is too thick, put in a tiny little bit of water.  Add salt and pepper to taste.
3. Cut the cream cheese into little squares, and throw it in a small saucepan. Simmer it on medium heat until it softens (it'll take 5 minutes or so). Throw in the queso fresco, and keep it in low heat while you finish. You want to keep it there until you serve it. 
4. Take the hibiscus flowers out of the water, and dry them well with a couple of paper towels.  
5. On a frying pan, heat two tablespoons of canola oil. Once it starts smoking, throw in the hibiscus flowers until they get crunchy (it'll take a minute or two, so watch out!).
6. Heat the tortillas. 
7. When you're ready to serve, bring the tortillas, the cheesy mixture, the hibiscus flowers, and the green salsa to the table. 
8. To serve: grab a tortilla, spread a good portion of the cheesy mixture into it, and top it with the hibiscus flowers and the green salsa.
