# Central Texas Smoked Brisket

Recipe by Tim Davis (vtimd)

When some folks think of BBQ, they think of hamburgers and hotdogs. When people in the South (of the US) think of BBQ, they're specifically thinking of smoked meats. And in Texas, that meat is beef brisket. The central Texas brisket is the pinnacle of BBQ in the world. It can be so simple to make, but takes practice to master. Every steer is different, so it's not an exact science. You'll need some beef, and as much time / patience as you can get. Let's get into it!

## What you need:

- Smoker
  - Honestly, this can be done in whatever you have, even an oven. But a real smoker is where you're going to get the carbon particles to properly bond with the rub to create bark. Otherwise it's just a crust.
- Constant temperature probe
- Instant Read Thermometer probe
- Foil or Butcher Paper to Wrap
- "Full Packer" brisket (ask your butcher)
  - This can be done with just the point or flat section, it will just cut time off the cook.

## The Rub

This is the secret to true Central Texas style brisket. It is so simple, yet so effective. 

### Ingredients

- 50% 16-mesh ground black peppe
  - Any coarse black pepper will do, if that's all you have. Just not finely ground table-pepper. 
- 50% Morton's Kosher Salt

That's it! 1:1 Salt to Pepper!

## The Brisket

Ideally, this should be done with a "full packer" brisket. This means the complete brisket, including the "Point" and "Flat" muscles. It should be anywhere from 10-20LBS if you have the right cut. If you only have access to the Point or the Flat separately, this is ok. The Point is the "marbled" side, and the "flat" is the leaner side. Use what you can get, adjust your cook accordingly. 

I highly recommend you check out YouTube for detailed instructions on Brisket trimming. There are so many methods. The basic "backyard" trim is to remove all the "hard" fat from the backside that won't render out. Trim the fat cap to 1/4" thick and evenly. Remove any meat and silverskin from the meat side. 

Once trimmed, apply the rub dense and even. Let it fly! The rub is what creates the bark. As a general rule: Apply how much rub you think is enough, then double it. It takes more than you think. Let the rub adhere and sweat the meat for 30 or so minutes before you smoke it. 

## The Cooking Part

Let's get to the fun stuff!

### The Smoke

Set the smoker (or oven) to 225F. Make sure it's holding evenly before you put the brisket in. Pellet grills and smokers with temp controllers make the job easier. You need a constant steady heat. Don't keep opening the lid to look at it! If you're lookin' you aint cookin'! :)

This is the important bit. You'll hear so many people talk about "X minutes per LB" and all that. Throw that out the window. We're all about temperature. So put your constant temp probe in the thickest part of the flat muscle. Personally, I like to put the brisket on the smoker around 9-10PM before I go to bed, and let it smoke overnight. If it's a smaller piece of a brisket, you can do it in the morning. You want plenty of time to cook, and rest. You'll keep it on the 225F smoker until the brisket reaches around 140-160F internal temperature. Every steer is different, so even with similar sized briskets, the time this takes can vary quite a bit. 

### The Stall

This part can be scary, because it's unpredictable. Most briskets will generally *stall*. This just means it will look like it stops cooking. Trust me, it's fine. I actually count on this. This is when I wrap. It can be anywhere from 140-160F, and it can last for *hours* until you force it to break the stall, or just wait it out. Trust me, this is all part of the process of breaking down and rendering the fat into juicy goodness. 

### The Wrap

This part can come at different times. I wrap at the stall. Usually 140-160F, or whenever I feel like it when I wake up in the morning. This helps lock in the moisture, and finish the cook. Pull the brisket out of the smoker and wrap it up tight with foil, or even better, "peach" butcher paper if you can get it. If this is your first brisket, foil is more forgiving to moisture, but it can make your bark a bit softer. Wrap it tight, and put it back on the smoker. You can crank it up to 350F now to break the stall and finish it up faster. Now, we wait again until our constant probe hits 203F!  

### Finishing the Cook

This is where things get interesting. I start checking my brisket for "doneness" at about 203F. I am not looking for specific temps any longer. It's basically done. I know it's "done" for temp. I am looking for tenderness. Stick the instant read probe into the brisket at the thick part. When it goes in smooth like butter, it's done. Anywhere from 203-210F. It's all about feel. It takes a while for the collagen (fat) to convert to gelatin. This is what makes it moist and not chewy. 

### The Rest

You absolutely, without a doubt, cannot skip this step. Muscle fibers contract with heat, and push out moisture. When you rest your meat, it provides time for those fibers to relax, and draw moisture back in to settle. Take the brisket off the smoker (still wrapped in foil or paper), wrap it in a towel, and throw it in a cooler. You want a full packer to rest for a *minimum* of 3 hours. It will stay piping hot for even 5 hours in a good wrap / cooler. As long as it stays above 140F you're good. 

### Slicing

This is another one of those things that YouTube can help with. But, basically, you want to slice across the grain, not with the grain. The tricky part is that the point and the flat muscles run different directions. You'll cut one way on the flat, and essentially perpendicular on the point. Make slices roughly the thickness of a pencil, or really, as thick as you see fit :)

**Now it's time to eat!**
