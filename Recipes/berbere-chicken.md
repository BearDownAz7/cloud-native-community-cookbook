# Berbere chicken

Treva Nichole Williams (Replicated)

This recipe was inspired by the delicious [Engagement Chicken](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/engagement-roast-chicken-recipe-1948980) recipe originally created by my wealthy pretend auntie, Ina Garten. During KubeCon Austin I had the opportunity to try Ethiopian food for the first time, which led to an intense love affair with doro wat. Doro wat isn’t necessarily hard to make, but it takes time & focus - two things that I am frequently bereft of. This adaptation gives all of the delicious flavors of the original stew without the mess or the need to sob over a pot of onions for hours at a time.

Preparation: ~15 minutes, not including chicken bath
cooking time: 1hr 15min

Serves 4-6 people, or one person a whole bunch of times. Also makes the best sandwiches ever.

### Equipment

- Oven preheated to 425ºƒ
- A large bowl with cover
- A small bowl for salt
- Medium dutch oven or baking pan with high sides (the pan should be only slightly wider than the chicken)
- A whole bunch of salt. Seriously you can’t have too much salt.
- paper towels
- Clorox wipes for cleanup
- Small saucepan for making compound butter
- Food safe brush
- Kitchen twine for trussing chicken

### Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken, ~8-10lbs thawed
- 2-4 lemons &/or limes, halved
- 1c. Salt. Yes, seriously.
- 2 tbls black pepper
- 3 heaping tbls. berbere seasoning (adjust this to your taste. Berbere is pretty spicy)
- 1 half stick of butter (can be substituted with olive or coconut oil but idk why you would do that)
- 3 whole large yellow onions
- 1 whole garlic bulb

## Chicken cleaning 
(optional, but i’m judging you if you don’t do it)

**Note**: cleaning meat, while frowned upon by some, is a very common practice in Caribbean & African kitchens. While I can’t say for sure that cleaned meat is actually any “cleaner” after soaking, I do know that the salt brine helps to add moisture to your meats. Just… don’t try to clean ground beef, I don’t think that’ll turn out well.


Remove & discard chicken innards. Place the chicken in a large bowl, then fill with cool water so that the bird is fully submerged. SSueeze lemon/lime juice into the water, then toss the sliced wedges in with the chicken. 

Using ½ cup of salt & one of the citrus halves, scrub the chicken thoroughly all over. Cover, then let the chicken rest in the refrigerator for at least 15-20 min, or 2hrs max (the citrus will start to “cook” the meat if left too long).

## Preparation 

Preheat your oven to 425º. 

While the chicken is soaking, roughly chop 4 large garlic cloves. Slice the rest of the bulb in half. You don’t need to remove the skin or separate the remaining cloves. Peel & slice your onions into quarters. Separate 8 onion quarters & toss into your baking pan.

throw your butter (or oil) into a saucepan on low heat with the diced garlic & one tablespoon of berbere powder. Heat while stirring gently until the butter is completely melted & the garlic is fragrant. Set aside to cool slightly.

After at least 20 minutes have elapsed, remove the chicken from the refrigerator & rinse well. Dry thoroughly with paper towels, then place in your baking pan on top of the onions. Wipe down your sink & all counters well with clorox wipes or disinfectant of choice.

Salt the inside of the chicken cavity with all but 2tbls of the remaining salt. Stuff the cavity with the halved garlic bulb & 4 onion quarters.

Using a spoon or your hands, separate the chicken skin from the meat on the breast & thighs. Truss the chicken legs by tying together with twine. Tuck chicken wings under the bird to prevent them from burning.

Using a kitchen brush or your hands, coat the chicken skin with the compound butter mixture. For extra flavor, pour/tuck any remaining butter between the separated chicken skin on the breast & thighs.

Sprinkle the chicken liberally with remaining salt, pepper & berbere powder, making sure to coat the bird evenly. 

## Cooking

Place uncovered pan in oven. Roast for 1 hour & 15 minutes, or until juices run clear when you slice between a leg & thigh. Remove from the oven & allow to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. Enjoy.
