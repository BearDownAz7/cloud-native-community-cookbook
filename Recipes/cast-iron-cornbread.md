# Cast Iron cornbread

Treva Nichole Williams (Replicated)

A handful of flour, a handful of cornmeal, a peench of salt & a little bit of sugar for the kids. That was the foundation of a family staple that was served at practically every meal, yet was still considered a treat every time. Each family matriarch had her own special variation - my Great x5 grandma Garner swore by buttermilk, Great grandma Catherine insisted that you add TWO eggs for fluffiness, Grandma Carrie could make a whole meal by layering the batter with a can of corn & some ground beef, it wasn't done until the edges were a little black according to my mom, & they ALL insisted that it be prepared in a cast iron skillet. 

Cornbread has always been serious business in my family, so it didn't take long before it came time for me to come up with my own spin on a staple that has sustained my family for generations. After years of experimentation - mostly spent trying to to convert "a peench" into imperial units - I finally feel like I've captured the essence of our family's dinner table during The Good Days - warm, sweet, & full of love. 

## Equipment:

- oven
- large mixing bowl
- sifter
- wooden spoon (it makes things taste better)
- measuring cups
- measuring spoons
- 10" cast iron pan

## Ingredients

- 1c flour
- 1c yellow cornmeal (or white, I'm not the boss of you)
- 1/4c honey
- (optional) 1/4c sugar
- 1 stick of brown butter + 1 tbls. for baking
- 2 eggs (room temperature)
- 1/2c milk (feel free to get creative here)
- 1 tsp salt (I prefer kosher, but you do you)
- 1/2 tsp of baking powder
- 1/2 tsp of baking soda

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425ยบ. While oven is heating, brown the butter in your cast iron by cooking on low-med heat for 7-10 minutes, or until the butter is golden with little brown bits at the bottom of the pan. Pour the butter into a heat-safe container to cool slightly.
2. Sift all dry ingredients together in a large bowl. set aside.
3. Once the butter has cooled a bit, add in your eggs, milk & honey. Mix well.
4. Using a wooden spoon, combine wet & dry ingredients until just mixed. Don't worry about lumps. Cover loosely & set mixture aside in a warm area to rest for 10-15minutes.
5. While mixture is resting, add 1 tablespoon of butter to your cast iron pan, then put in the oven until the cornbread mixture has fully hydrated.
6. Carefully remove the heated cast iron from the oven, then *quickly* add your cornbread batter in an even layer. There will be some sizzling, so be careful.
7. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the center makes a hollow "thump" when tapped.
8. Allow to cool for 5-10 minutes before cutting.
