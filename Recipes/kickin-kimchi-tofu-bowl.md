# **Kickin’ Kimchi Tofu Bowl**
#### Shannon Williams (Suse)

Shannon learned to cook from his mom, who learned to cook from her dad James Skikos, a Greek immigrant who worked in restaurants for many years. James died right before Shannon was born, but he still thinks of him whenever he’s in the kitchen: “He always cooked without recipes, so that’s how my mom cooked, and that’s how I cook now.” Shannon takes pride in eyeballing things, and loves the intuitive process of cooking as much as anything else. “It makes you more risk tolerant. You don’t worry about it being right. Whatever I have goes in the pot and it almost always tastes good, as long as you’re liberal with the spices and use lots of fresh ingredients.”

Shannon used to travel a lot for work, and since the pandemic he’s been working on recreating some of his favorite dishes back home in California. This Kimchi Tofu Bowl is inspired by a meal he had in Korea, where it’s traditionally served as a light dish to have with a beer. Shannon now frequently makes a version of this for lunch. He can whip it up in ten minutes during his lunch break, add whatever fresh vegetables he has on hand, serve it with rice or alone, and: voilá!

## INGREDIENTS

* 1-2 cups of kimchi (Shannon uses the giant tub from Costco)
* 1/2 package of firm tofu (cubed)
* 1/2 onion, chopped
* 1/4 pound ground pork (optional, but delicious)
* 1-2 tablespoons sesame oil
* 1-2 tablespoons of ginger (grated or minced)
* 1 clove of garlic (grated or minced)
* soy sauce to taste
* 1-2 tablespoons of brown sugar or another sweetener
* 1-2 tablespoons of Chili
* Garlic Sauce (to taste)
* whatever lovely veggies are in the fridge, chopped

## DIRECTIONS

1. Get a wok hot and add the oil.
2. Saute the onion for a minute or two, then toss in the meat, kimchi, garlic, veggies, ginger, soy sauce and sugar. Simmer until cooked though.
3. Add tofu at the end. Cook for approximately 3-5 minutes.
4. Eat it as is, or toss it over rice.
5. Add the Chili Garlic Sauce (or your favorite hot sauce) to taste.
6. Optional variation: if in the mood for soup, add some chicken stock and turn it into a soup bowl on colder days!
