# Yangzhou Fried Rice
#### Recipe by Lian Li (Loft Labs)

Growing up in a Chinese household, even in Germany, meant eating rice twice a day, every day. With the same old side dishes which consisted mainly of pork and soy sauce.
When I moved out, I celebrated my new found freedom by swearing off rice and only having bread and potatoes for years.
Lately I've reacquianted myself with some long forgotten traditions. I bought a wok and have been stir frying everything I could get ahold of. And I'm proud to say that I've finally conquered my endboss: making a rice based dish that is simple, varied and delightful. This can easily be a vegetarian dish by leaving out the meats. I suppose it could also be made vegan but I've never tried.

The thing I love most about Fried Rice is that every dish is unique. I almost never grocery shop for fried rice, working only with leftover ingredients. However, I did start from a recipe first and with some time and experience, learned how to switch out individual ingredients while still maintaining the classic Fried Rice flavour.
A common misconception is that you need a wok to make fried rice. That's actually not true. It's all in the technique and order in which the ingredients are added. My mom makes fried rice in a deep "European style" frying pan and it's just as good.

So with all this out of the way, here we go and I hope you'll enjoy a classic dish that can eliminate all your leftovers forever.

## Ingredients
The ingredients should eventually be diced to about 2cm / 1" cubes before they go into the wok. We want to keep everything regularly sized and shaped so it's easy to eat with chopsticks.
All amounts below are approximations, I rarely weigh anything. Most is eyeballed.

- 6 dried shiitake mushrooms, reconsituted (save the liquid, about 6 tbsp)
- 2½ tsp sugar
- 1½ salt
- 1 tsp cornstarch
- 2 tsp chicken stock powder 
- 3 tsp Liaojiu also known as Shaoxing wine, Huangjiu, Chinese Rice Cooking Wine
- 2 cloves garlic
- 4cm knob ginger
- 100g shrimp
- 70g Pork Loin
- 60g Chicken Thigh
- 3 tbsp frying oil with high smoke point (e.g. peanut) or lard
- 1 (ca. 70g) Lap Cheong
- 250g of various veggies, e.g. peas, carrots, corn, celery, broccoli, edamame...
- 3 Eggs
- 250g jasmine rice ideally leftover
- 4 sprigs scallions, sliced

## Instructions

### Preparation

1. Take some leftover rice or prepare some fresh rice, then leave it out unlidded so it can lose some of its moisture. Fried rice needs to be prepared with rice that is as dry as possible. 
2. Soak Shiitake Mushrooms for at least 2h in hot, but not boiling water.
3. Marinate shrimp with ¼ tsp salt and ½ tsp cornstarch.
4. Marinate chicken and pork with ¼ tsp salt, ½ tsp sugar and ½ tsp cornstarch.
5. Finely dice garlic and ginger.
6. Prepare veggies by thawing, blanching, dicing etc. Keeping in mind that they will be cooked for only a very short time.
7. Make the sauce by mixing 1 tsp salt, 2 tsp sugar, 2 tsp stock powder, 3 tsp Liaojiu and 6 tbsp of the mushroom soaking liquid.
8. Roughly scramble the eggs. The egg white and yolk do not need to mix homogenously. In fact it's better if they don't.

### Frying

When you start from an empty wok, add 1tbsp of frying oil or lard and make sure that the oil is as hot as you can get it without risk of injury.

1. Fry Shrimp until done (one to two minutes), then take out for later.
2. Fry garlic & ginger until aromatic (a couple of seconds), add meats and fry for about one minute until almost done.
3. Add shiitake mushrooms and fry for about a minute.
4. Add Lap cheong, fry for thirty seconds.
5. Add the veggies and white part of the scallions, then fry for about one to two minutes.
6. Increase heat to high and add the sauce. Give everything in a good stir or shake.
7. Once the sauce starts boiling (which happens quite quickly), take everything out including the sauce. Leave nothing in the wok.
8. Over high heat, fry the eggs by letting it set a bit, then fold over. We do not want regular scrambled eggs, but an almost done omelett.
9. Add rice and mix with the egg, chopping up the omelett in small pieces. Regularly stir the mixture.
10. Once the individual rice grains are dry enough to start separating, add the meat veggie mix and fry for about one minute until all the liquid is gone.
11. Add shrimps and the green part of the scallions.
12. Give it a try. If it comes out a bit bland, some well deployed MSG will usually do the trick.
13. Serve and top with some coriander and sesame seeds if you're fancy.
