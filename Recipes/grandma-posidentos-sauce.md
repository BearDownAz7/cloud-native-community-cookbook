# Grandma Posidento's Sauce with Meatballs
#### Nicholas Eberts (Google)

While I am only 1/4 Sicilian, my anonn came over to Brooklyn from Palermo during "the Great Arrival" and she was a constant reminder of the Italiano part of my heritage while living in her house during grammar school. This recipe started with Sicilian roots, but my annon was not your everyday Sicilian housewife. She was a master of organization, typing, and Latin (yes Latin), and found a career working in network television studios ghostwriting for execs. Often Grandma would come home regaling tails of collective bosses' inadequate grammar. So ya, Grandma is an OG feminist and I adore her for that. But the point is, she was not at home making sauce all day so the duty was shared with Gramps. Gramps was not Italian, he was a mix of German and Iroquis, and more importantly, and food engineer. The man knew flavors and iterated on his powerful wife's recipe to the point of perfection. This is my humble contribution to the community. Sicilian base layered with German ingenuity. This recipe defines comfort food for me and I hope the community can find some comfort in its preparation, and community-style serving. You make a giant pot and distribute it to your neighborhood - this is the way. Manja.

## Ingredients

### Sauce
* Olive Oil
* 1 cup onion, chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* Red pepper flakes to taste
* 3/4 cup red wine or sherry
* 1 tablespoon dry oregeno
* 1 tablespoon dry basil
* 1/3 cup romano cheese, grated
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 4 cans (28 oz) San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes
* Good Italian Sausage (mild or hot or both)

### Meatballs
* 1/2 cup cold water
* 1/2 cup bread crumbs
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 1/2 lbs chopped meat (80%)
* 1/3 cup romano cheese, grated
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper

## Directions

### Sauce
1. Brown sausage in the sauce pot and set aside. 
2. Coat sauce pot with olive oil and add onion and red pepper flakes.
3. When onion is soft (not carmelized) add garlic and saute until fragrant (about a minute).
4. Add wine and burn off alcohol - I guess this takes a minute or two.
5. Add tomatoes, basil, oregeno, sugar, salt, and stir together. Bring the sauce to a simmer for about half an hour. 
6. Get an immersion blender, puree the sauce, add the sausages back in the pot and cook for no less than 5 hours while stirring every 30 mins of so. 
7. TASTE IT, adjust, make it your own :) 

### Meatballs
1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
2. In a large bowl combine water, bread crumbs, and eggs; stir to blend; let stand for 5 minutes. Add the meat and reamining ingredients.
3. Shape meat into balls, place them on a lightley oiled sheet pan, and cook them for 5 minutes a side.
4. Add the meatballs to the sauce - I usually time this so that the meatballs get dropped in when I have 2.5 hours left on the sauce cooking time.
