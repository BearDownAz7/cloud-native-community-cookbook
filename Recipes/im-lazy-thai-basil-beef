**I'm Lazy Thai Basil Beef**

Recipe by Marino Wijay

When I get slammed and I need something easy to make, ground beef becomes pretty darn versatile. I love spicey, I love flavor, and thai basil beef has it all. 
Pair this with jasmin rice and you have a dish you'll consider to be crack. Thai basil beef is also known as Pad Gra Prow

Ingredients:
- 1/2 lb of lean or medium ground beef
- 2 shallots finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
- 1 cup of thai basil leaves (frozen basil works too)
- 2 red or green thai chillies, chopped to your tolerance (WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER)
- 2 Tbsp of sesame oil
- 2 Tbps of low-sodium soy sauce
- 1-2 Tbps of oyster sauce
- 1 tsp of cayenne powder
