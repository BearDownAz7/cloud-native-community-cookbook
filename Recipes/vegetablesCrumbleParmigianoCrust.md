# Vegetables Crumble with Parmigiano Crust
#### Philippe Ensarguet
I am Philippe and I live in France. Please be indulgent, because just because one lives in the country of one of the best cuisine in the world, doesn't mean that one is automatically a 3 star Michelin chef! As far as I remember, cooking and eating have always been a moment of joy, pleasure and sharing.

My grandparents were farmers, and my head is still full of memories of family gatherings with a table of 15 people, many starters and 3-course meals that started a little before noon and ended at dusk. When you are a child, you might think that it was long, but in fact it wasn't. When you are a child, this might feel like a long time, but in fact it wasn't. From those times, I cherish the pleasure of choosing, preparing and consuming beautiful and good meals. Eating is an important moment of the day which has a direct impact on my mood and motivation! 

For health reasons, then by conviction, I became vegetarian, and one of the first dishes I cooked for my family and friends was this vegetable crumble with a parmigiano crust.

## Ingredients for 4 SERVINGS

To make this, we need to cook first the vegetables, then to make the salted crumble, before assembling the dish.

- **Vegetables**:
    - 8-10 green asparagus
    - 4 carrots
    - 2 red peppers
    - 3 parsnips
    - 2 big onions
    - 1 clove of garlic

- **Salted Crumble**:
    - a pinch of salt
    - 150 g of flour
    - 40 g of pine nuts
    - 40 g pumpkin seeds
    - 100 g butter
    - 80 g Parmesan cheese (the same one as POP, and yes, you would be baned to not buy good one)

## Directions

1. Step 1
    Wash the vegetables well before preparing them: cut the asparagus into 3 or 4 pieces (depending on their size), slice the peppers, cut the carrots into thin slices, cut the parsnips into cubes, slice the onion and garlic.
    
2. Step 2
    In a large frying pan, generously pour olive oil to cook the vegetables, starting with the onion and garlic first, which should brown slightly. Then add the other vegetables by cooking time: first the carrots, then the parsnip, the bell peppers and at the end the asparagus. The idea is not to overcook the vegetables, which should remain crunchy. My best advice is to simply taste them to make sure they don’t become too soft.

3. Step 3
    Now it's time for the salted crumble! Preheat the oven to thermostat 6 (180°C) and prepare the crumbs for the salted crumble: mix the flour, parmesan and butter with your fingertips. Add salt and the pine nuts and pumpkin seeds. 

4. Step 4
    Put the vegetables in a Pyrex dish and spread the crumbs on top: that should make a nice crust. Let them cook in the hot oven for 20 to 30 minutes. Since the vegetables are already cooked, you just have to monitor when the salted crumble is ready.

5. Step 5

    You can serve the Vegetables Crumble with Parmigiano Crust in 3 different ways:
    1. Simply with a nice lettuce salad.
    2. With a whole roast fish (such as codfish).
    3. With a rare Duck Magret.

    Of course, back to my intro, you can guess which is my favorite one, but my kids love it with option 3.
