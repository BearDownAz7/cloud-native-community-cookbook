# Salmorejo
#### Jason Yee

Since Kubecon EU 2022 was hosted in Spain, here's a Spanish dish to help keep you cool in the hot Mediterranean summer (or really anywhere, any time).

While most people are familiar with Gazpacho, Spain's most famous cold soup, Salmorejo from Andaluc√≠a is also quite popular in Spain. Salmorejo tends to be thicker, creamer, and less vegetal than Gazpacho. It's also much easier to make and has fewer ingredients. The only equipment required is a blender.

Preparation time is about 5 minutes. Serves 4 people.

## INGREDIENTS

- 8 ripe tomatoes roughly chopped
- 2 cups of stale bread torn into pieces. White bread works best, but if you have a crusty bread, just cut the crust off. Avoid using whole wheat or grainy bread as it'll result in a poor texture.
- 1 cup extra virign olive oil
- 1 clove of garlic. Yes, I know you love garlic. I do too. Don't be tempted to add more.
- 1/4 tsp of kosher salt
- a splash of sherry vinegar
- 2 hard boiled eggs roughly chopped (optional)
- 1/2 cup sliced serrano ham (optional)

## DIRECTIONS

1. Place the chopped tomatoes, bread, garlic clove, salt, and sherry vinegar into the blender and blend for a couple minutes until it all comes together.
2. With the blender still on, slowly add the olive oil and continue blending until smooth.
3. Divide into 4 bowls and serve cold. Top with the hard boiled egg and serrano ham.
