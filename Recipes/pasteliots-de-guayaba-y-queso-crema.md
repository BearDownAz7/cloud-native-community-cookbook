# Pastelitos de Guayaba y Queso Crema
#### Ariel Jatib (Cloud Native)

Ariel was born in Cuba and has warm memories of being in his grandmother’s kitchen on the family farm and of eating ice cream at Coppelia park in Havana. But his most formative food memories are steeped in the rich culinary streets of Miami, where his family settled when he was eight. Ariel enthusiastically describes the joy of going to the corner bakery for a cafecito or cafe con leche and some croquetas, and of the Colombian, Jamaican and Cuban food, music and language that suffused those streets of his youth.

Ariel now lives in the eclectic village of Sea Cliff, NY, a place he loves (“Old Victorian houses, hippies, kind of like a miniature San Francisco!”), but he yearns for access to the rich and flavorful food cultures he grew up around. “What I miss most about Miami is the cheap and affordable Hispanic food on every corner,” he says. Before the pandemic Ariel would fill that yearning by finding interesting restaurants and cafes when he traveled. “Every time I went to Chicago I would go to the Cuban restaurant first thing. No deep dish pizza for me,” he says with a smile. But this past year, unable to travel, he decided to “make do and get scrappy” in his own kitchen, recreating the Cuban food he loves and misses, like these Pastelitos. “My kids don’t like them,” he says. “And they’re not great for my waist line.” But it’s clear from the way he lights up talking about them that they are delicious and absolutely taste like home.
