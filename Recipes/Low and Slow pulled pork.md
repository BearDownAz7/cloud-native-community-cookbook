# Low and Slow pulled pork

Recipe by Dan Finneran (Loft Labs)

This recipe is more a process of trial and error, success and failure and 5PM meals finally being ready to eat at 10PM. This cook comes with the opportunity to break out **all** the BBQ gadgets or simply let nature take its course (with a lot of nervous watching and manual temperature checks). 

With an alarm clock set early enough you can create a mountain of pulled pork ready for a late afternoons consumption, alternatively create the pork at a time more suiting and you'll find that the pork can easily be reheated without losing any flavour or texture. 

## Requirements

- A close lid BBQ/Smoker (Ceramic BBQ is recommended where possible)
- A 2KG Pork Shoulder / Boston Butt (any size is fine, but timings are based upon 2KG)
- (recommended) wood chips for flavour
- (recommended) Digital BBQ thermometer
- (optional) BBQ/Smoker controller (automates controlling the temperature of the BBQ, also generates pretty graphs!)
- Patience ... **lots** of patience

## The Rub

This will add a lightly spicy and smokey rub to the outside/crust of the pork!

### Ingredients

- 2 tbsp paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp chilli powder
- 2 tsp salt & pepper

Mix the ingredients together into a bowl, and then rub into a patted dry piece of Pork. The Pork is ready to be go on the BBQ at this point!

## The Pork

This is largely where science and planning go completely out of the window... 

### The Smoker Prep

The smoker should be lit and be set for "indirect" cooking i.e. it should have a plate (usually ceramic) inserted to stop the pork interacting directly with the flame and heat. The temperature that the you are looking for is around 110˚C/230°F, once you're around this heat you're ready to add some soaked wood chips into the Smoker (Hickery is recommended) and add your pork into the smoker (pop a drip tray underneath to try and stop too much fat dripping through the smoker if possible).

### The Cook

With your pork in the smoker you (*the reader*) will largely have placed your pork destiny in the hands of the universe.. If you have a smart probe enabled then you can largely sit back and let your phone tell you how the cook is going, with a manual probe you'll need to check every 30 mins or so after the first four hours of cooking. Every 2KG Pork cook I've done has resulted in a 12 hour cook to reach the magical 90˚C/196°F (ish) temperature that means that the pork has been low-and-slow cooked, however depending on the fat content of the pork or just the entropy of the universe can result in shorter or even longer cook.

The first four hours or so should see the pork steadily heat to around 65˚C-70˚C, which can be alarming as it looks like a twelve hour cook is actually going to take only six hours, fear not! as the stall is waiting in the darkness to cause pork frustration.

### The dreaded stall

At a certain point during the cook, everything will stop, if you're using a smart probe your graph will go flat for hours and in some cases the temperature may even dip. This can be a cause for panic as on the surface it makes no logical sense, however what is typically happening is that your meat is sweating! When the pork reaches a particular temperature moisture and fat is released from the pork where it comes to the surface (as sweat does on a person in a hot environment), the moisture will stall the temperature and possibly reduce it for a number of hours.

After an unspecified time this stall will end and the temperature will start to slowly rise again and you'll be in the end-zone of the magestical pulled pork!

## Serving up

Once your pork has reached the magical 90˚C/196°F (ish) temperature take it from the smoker and place on a chopping board, then cover with foil and let it rest for 15 minutes. 

After the 15 minutes tear the pork apart with two forks or any other implement that will produce the same sort of results (a big old pile of smokey pulled pork). The pork can be served on a plate with other sides, if being placed in a sandwich then use simple white bap/breadcakes **not** brioche buns as they're too heavy. 

**enjoy**

## Reheating

If you've been unable to consume the full 2KG of pulled pork (hang your head in shame) then place in a bowl and cover in the fridge until you're ready to try again. To reheat the pulled pork place the pork into a oven dish, add a small amount of water (to generate steam) and cover with tin foil. The oven should be set to 110˚C/230°F, and in 30-40 mins the pork will have been heated and steamed (to keep the meat moist). Time to re-enjoy all that pork goodness!
