# Amazing Roasted Cauliflower Salad
#### Amye Scavarda Perrin (Linux Foundation)

Growing up in the hills of Idyllwild, a small rural  town nestled in the San Jacinto mountains of Southern California, (and without a doubt the most beautifully named town in the US of A), Amye says cooking was the form of entertainment for her family. Her mom mostly cooked “typical American cuisine,” but her dad loved to experiment in the kitchen, and Amye did too. In college she discovered The Zuni Cafe Cookbook and realized that cooking could be not only a gastronomical thrill, but a way of traveling and knowing the world as well.

Now, living in Portland, Amye and her husband Jim cook a four-star meal every night of the week. “We start every evening by saying, well, where do we want to go tonight?” Amye says. And then they’re off, plucking one of their forty cookbooks off their shelves and settling in for an evening of prepping, seasoning, cooking, and, of course, feasting. Jim mostly cooks the main dish, while Amye focuses on the salads and the sauce. “It’s all about the sauce,” Amye says. “The textures and the flavors.” The two of them love cooking so much that in lieu of wedding engagement rings they redid their kitchen. Now that is love.

## Ingredients


* 1 medium cauliflower grapeseed oil for cooking
* 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt 
* 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
* 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice (seriously, you want fresh lime, I promise)
* lime zest (optional)
* 2 tablespoons your favorite fish sauce
* 1 tablespoon sweet chili sauce
* 1/2 cup roasted hazelnuts: chop half, leave half whole for interesting photos
* One handful of either flat leaf parsley or cilantro, roughly chopped. (Cilantro preferred, but some people think it tastes like soap. Don’t soap your food.)

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF, convection if you have it.
2. Rip that cauliflower apart! You want everything to be roughly the same size. Toss with some grapeseed oil and salt. Roast for 15 minutes, stir, roast for another 15. You want these to be *beyond* golden brown and delicious; you want them to be very dark and crunchy. The last five minutes or so, add the hazelnuts to toast them alongside the cauliflower. Let cool.
4. Make the dressing. Combine sesame oil, lime juice, fish sauce and chili sauce. Lime zest is optional but delicious.
5. Combine!
