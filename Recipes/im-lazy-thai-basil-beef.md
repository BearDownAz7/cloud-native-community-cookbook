# **I'm Lazy Thai Basil Beef**

#### Recipe by Marino Wijay

Thai basil beef (aka Pad Gra Prow) is a staple in our household. It's easy to make, it's tasty, it's filling. YUM.
When I get slammed and I need something easy to make, this becomes our go-to at home. 
I love spicey, I love flavor, and thai basil beef has it all. 

Pair this with jasmin rice and you have a dish that's basically crack. 

## Ingredients:
- 1/2 lb of lean or medium ground beef
- 2 shallots finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tsp of ginger paste or chopped ginger
- 1 cup of thai basil leaves (frozen basil works too)
- 2 red or green thai chillies, chopped to your tolerance (WASH YOUR HANDS AFTER)
- 2 Tbsp of sesame oil
- 2 Tbps of low-sodium soy sauce
- 1-2 Tbps of oyster sauce
- 1 tsp of cayenne powder
- Cilantro for garnish

## Directions:

1. Chop up shallots, garlic, ginger (if not using paste), chillies.
2. WASH YOUR HANDS YOU DONT WANT SPICEY IN YOUR EYES!.
3. In a medium frying pan, add sesame oil, and HEAT THAT UP TO MEDIUM (insert fire emoji).
4. Add your chopped stuff to the pan and sauté until shallots start turning brown.
5. Add ground beef and separate so it spreads through the pan gets kissed by that garlic/shallot/ginger combo.
6. Lower the heat to low-medium and sauté for about 15 minutes.
7. Add in soy sauce and oyster sauce, and keep that sauté going!
8. Add in cayenne powder and thai basil leaves and continue to sauté for another 15 minutes.
9. The juices/liquid should start to evaporate, and this point turn up the heat to medium-high, and sauté until the beef looks like it's becoming crispy.
10. Turn off the heat.
11. GET A BOWL AND GET THAT JASMIN RICE READY! (I'm sorry, I can't make rice, you're on your own).
12. Add your thai basil beef, garnish with cilantro.
13. ENJOY *chef kiss*.
