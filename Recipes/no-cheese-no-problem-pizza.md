# **No Cheese, No Problem Pizza**
#### Recipe by Alex Ellis (OpeanFaaS)

Alex lives with his wife in Peterborough, England, an “agricultural and industrial town between London and Cambridge, surrounded by countryside.” Though there’s plenty of farmland around, the culinary landscape of the city is pretty homogeneous (mostly chains and traditional English fare), and so Alex takes pleasure in creating the kinds of artisanal pizzas he used to only be able to find when traveling to London, New York or San Francisco. 

When Alex discovered he was allergic to dairy, he thought his pizza days might be over. But he’s found that he doesn’t miss the cheese at all, thanks to the tasty Parma ham in this recipe. Alex says, “This pizza is simple and easy to make for one or two people. Just start the dough a little early (say, at five) and you’ll have a gourmet pizza to enjoy by seven.”


## INGREDIENTS
### Dough
* 250 grams (about 9 ounces) of “00” pizza/pasta flour 1 teaspoon of dried yeast 180ml (6oz) luke-warm water 
* 10ml (2 teaspoons) extra virgin olive oil
* 2.5g (1/2 teaspoon) salt
* extra olive oil for drizzling

### Topping Suggestions
* tomato puree 
* nitrite-free Parma ham slices (optional)
* chestnut or field mushrooms, sliced
* green olives, sliced
* aubergine (eggplant), thinly sliced 
* cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced
* dried oregano
 
### Additional Notes
This dough recipe is closely related to a basic bread recipe, so you can adapt it to make buns or a simple loaf. Also, the recipe is for one pizza, but if you multiply the amounts, you can do two, three or even four pizzas. The dough can also be frozen if you have spare and used later on.

## DIRECTIONS

1. 1. Combine the warm water and oil in a large bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, yeast and salt.
3. Pour the flour mixture over the water/oil combo and mix with your hands.
4. Once thoroughly combined, empty onto a floured surface and knead for 10-12 minutes. If the dough feels wet, then knead for a few minutes longer. Resist the urge to add flour. Place the dough in a clean, floured bowl and leave for 1 to 1 1/2 hours to rise.
5. Preheat the oven to 430°C (220°F) or higher if possible. If you have a pizza stone, place it on the top shelf of the oven.
6. Slice any of the ingredients for the topping.
7. Once the dough is doubled in size, or when you can’t wait any longer, roll the dough out onto a piece of baking parchment.
8. Smear the tomato puree over the pizza base. (It doesn’t need to be even or to cover the whole area.) Drizzle with the extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with dried oregano.
9. Arrange the toppings however you like on the pizza. (Less is more with toppings. You want the pizza to cook well and become crispy on the bottom.)
10. Transfer the pizza to the oven on the parchment paper when it is at full heat. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until golden.
11. Serve with a salad of leafy greens and balsamic vinegar.
