# **Sublime Cacciatore**
#### Noah Abrahams (Stormforge)

Early in life Noah had a choice to make: try for a career in tech or go to culinary school. He was drawn to both, and had already spent time working as an amateur professional chef, cooking for over two-hundred people at a time at various conventions. But ultimately he chose tech. “Which was the right decision,” Noah says with a laugh. “Because I still love cooking.” Now he lives near Red Rock Canyon outside of Las Vegas, where he and his wife, Gina, also a culinary wizard, take turns in the kitchen. “When the weekend comes,” Noah says, “I’m going to spend four hours cooking something because I want to. And it’s going to make me feel good.” 

Noah says this recipe was a happy accident. The prosciutto they ordered came sliced thick like deli meat. Noah looked at all that marbled fat and, instead of throwing it out, decided to chop it like pancetta and render it. From there? Something beautiful was born. Noah serves this cacciatore over disks of fried polenta, which provides the “perfect crispy and creamy texture on the side.” He describes this as a, “rich, high-fat kind of dish. Rich and sublime.” And the stakes are high: Gina is Italian, and Noah says that, “With Italian dishes like this I have to bring my A game.” Does she approve? Noah smiles. She does.


## INGREDIENTS

* 6-8 ounces prosciutto, cut thick (like deli meat) 
* 1 large onion
* 1 pound mushrooms
* 4 chicken thighs, deskinned and de-boned a handful of olives (either kalamata or salt-cured), sliced in half
* 1 large can peeled tomatoes (San Marzano preferred)
* 1/2 tube concentrated tomato paste
* dried oregano (to taste) 
* 1 tube of polenta
* whole basil leaves (for garnish)

## DIRECTIONS

1. Render the prosciutto. (Note: you don’t HAVE to use prosciutto, which is expensive. A fatty ham, pancetta, or the like is a reasonable substitute to make this dish cost much less. You could even use some other source of fatty meat, if you don’t eat pork. The important part is getting the fat in the pan.) Chop 6-8 ounces of unfortunately-thick-cut prosciutto into 1/4 inch squares and slowly saute it in the pan over medium low heat, until most of the fat is cooked out. You don’t want the meat itself to get crispy.
2. Dice 1 large onion and slice one pound of mushrooms, then add them to the pan. Toss these in the rendered fat and cook over medium heat until the onions are translucent and some of the mushroom liquid cooks out.
3. Cut the chicken thighs into large cubes and add to the pan. (The thighs should be deskinned and deboned, but again, we want as much fat as possible, so don’t clean them too much.) Saute over medium-high heat until the chicken is mostly cooked through and lightly browned on the outside. If faced with the choice of unbrowned chicken or the previous ingredients getting crisped, err on the side of undercooking, which will be resolved in the next step.
4. Add your sliced olives, the large can of peeled tomatoes, half a tube of concentrated tomato paste and the dried oregano to taste. Stir it all together, and simmer over medium-low heat for as long as you reasonably have available. (Make sure the chicken is cooked through.)
5. While the above is simmering, take a tube of polenta, and without breaking it up, slice it into 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch thick discs. In a separate pan, fry the polenta discs in melted butter or olive oil. Serve the cacciatore next to the polenta discs, and garnish with whole basil leaves.
